### Things I had to change due to errors:

[Error: Invariant failed: You should not use <Switch> outside a <Router>]

/*
 * Warning: Failed prop type: You provided a value prop to a form
 * field without an onChange handler. This will render a read-only
 * field. If the field should be mutable use defaultValue.
 * Otherwise, set either onChange or readOnly.
